 For Homework due 4/24
Optimized CSS by aggregating multiple syntaxes into universal selector and other syntaxes that belonged in the same group with each other. Currently unable to aggregate multiple stand alone elements such as individual images. Will need to confer during office hours or tutor hour to understand why I could not aggregate them. Made copious notes in both HTML and CSS.
